Virus Spread Simulation in Unity3D
Overview

This project is a 3D simulation created using Unity3D to model how viruses can spread in an environment through human contact. The simulation allows users to adjust parameters such as the population size, the percentage of contagiousness, and the mortality rate of infected individuals. The goal is to provide a crude yet insightly way to look at how different factors influence the spread of a virus within a population.
Features

    Interactive Environment: A 3D world where individuals (represented by agents) move and interact with one another.
    Customizable Parameters: Users can modify:
        Population size: The number of agents in the simulation.
        Contagiousness: The likelihood that an infected person will spread the virus to a healthy individual.
        Mortality Rate: The probability of an infected individual dying from the virus.
    Real-Time Simulation: The agents move randomly, with interactions happening as they come into proximity with each other, spreading the virus if contagious.
    Simulation Results: At the end of the simulation, statistics are displayed, showing the total number of infected, recovered, and deceased individuals, as well as other key metrics.

Controls

    Population Size: Adjust the number of individuals in the environment.
    Contagiousness: Change the percentage chance that an infected person can transmit the virus to a healthy person.
    Mortality Rate: Set the likelihood that an infected person will die from the virus.
    Start Simulation: Click on the "Start" button to begin the simulation and observe the virus spread.

Results

Once the simulation ends, the following statistics will be displayed:

    Total population.
    Number of infected individuals.
    Number of deceased individuals.
    The percentage of the population that was infected or died.
